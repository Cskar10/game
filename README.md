Tentacle Game

## Run in a browser

Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser to explore the web version.

## Run as a desktop app

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Launch the Electron shell:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The Electron window simply wraps the existing canvas experience, so the physics and interactivity remain unchanged. To make a distributable build later on, add a packager such as `electron-builder` or `electron-packager`.
